Known bugs:
- browse appends a trailing / even to the last element (e.g. tracknr - title)
- leading wildcard fails (e.g. .../Moon Safari/*Sexy Boy) if multiple keys in field

Improvements:
- 0-pad the tracknum for easier completion
- when parsing tracknum and querying, transform to int (remove leading 0)
- throw error if too many elements (e.g. title/foo/bar/...)
